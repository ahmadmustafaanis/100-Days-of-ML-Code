# Day 14 of #100DaysOfMLCode

### Today I learned about how to manage your data when there is dev and test set from different distributions and how to itereate quickly thorugh your model to get quick insghits for error analysis.

### Particiapted in Kaggle Titanic Competeion and got 76% accuracy using simple Neural Network with Keras. I am a little bit sad because I wanted more but just could not manage to find enough corelations in data.
