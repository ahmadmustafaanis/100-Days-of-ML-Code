Today I learned about Padding, which is an important concept in Convolutional Neural Networks where we padd an image before applying convolutional operator on them to retain the actual size of image and to make sure that we are not loosing information along edges

I also learned about Strided Convolutions which is also an important topic in convolutional neural networks where we instead of taking 1 jump in while applying convolutional operator, we jump S times where S is number of Strides
